When using computers on a network (primarily at work), there is sometimes the issue of unauthorized individuals accessing personal files created by the user.
In a work environment, this can be problematic as someone without proper authorization or clearance could see content they shouldn't.

My software addresses this issue, inspired by my personal experience.
Often, when working on a school computer (not necessarily in computer science or cybersecurity classes), I would save a file at school only to discover later that someone had accessed and altered it.
My software prevents this by blocking unauthorized users from viewing or modifying files.
Additionally, it allows uploading files to the cloud for secure access from any device running the app.

Using both C# and Python to create this project, I made it possible to upload encrypted files (in a format I created especially, .cb files) to a remote cloud, managed server & clients, built a GUI, and managed users using a DB (SQLite).

This project was my final project back in High School.
